# Machine-Learning-Boosted-Decision-Trees-and-SVM-implementation
 Predicted whether person’s income is higher or lower than $50k/year based on their attributes
 Implemented both algorithms (XGBoost and SVM) on a training dataset comprising of 32,561 samples and
123 features by calibrating hyperparameters (like max depth, lambda; C, gamma)
 Achieved accuracies of over 85% for both algorithms on a testing dataset with 16,281 samples
